# PIO Unit Testing and project tests.

`LDR_Measurements.ino` this file was used to get a Light - Resistance curve of the LDR to decide if it ca be used in this Project since the ISR needs a clear High-Low input and cannot work with analog signals

```diff
- this directory is currently not used to full extend since the Hardware is not ready for software testing yet
- and the software also continuosly changing which makes coding extensive testing programms impractical.
```

Unit Testing is a software testing method by which individual units of
source code, sets of one or more MCU program modules together with associated
control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to
determine whether they are fit for use. Unit testing finds problems early
in the development cycle.
